# Infinite Cards - iOS App

An AI card generating game built with Swift and UIKit.

## Project Structure

```
InfiniteCards/
├── AppDelegate.swift               # App entry point (like index.js in React)
├── Card.swift                      # Data model (like TypeScript interfaces)
├── cards.json                      # Card data
├── CardsListViewController.swift   # Main screen (like App.js)
├── CardCollectionViewCell.swift    # Card component (like Card.jsx)
├── CardDetailViewController.swift  # Detail popup (like Modal component)
└── UIImage+Gradient.swift          # Helper extension for gradient images
```

## Architecture Comparison: Swift/iOS vs React

### Components
- **React**: Function/Class Components with JSX
- **Swift**: UIViewController (containers) + UIView (visual components)

### State Management
- **React**: useState, useReducer, Context API
- **Swift**: Properties in ViewControllers, delegates, NotificationCenter

### Lifecycle
- **React**: useEffect, componentDidMount, etc.
- **Swift**: viewDidLoad, viewWillAppear, viewDidAppear, etc.

### Layout
- **React**: CSS, Flexbox, CSS-in-JS
- **Swift**: Auto Layout constraints (programmatic or Interface Builder)

### Lists
- **React**: map() over arrays, FlatList in React Native
- **Swift**: UITableView or UICollectionView with DataSource pattern

### Navigation
- **React**: React Router, React Navigation
- **Swift**: UINavigationController, present/push ViewControllers

## Key iOS/Swift Concepts

1. **ViewControllers**: Manage a screen's logic and lifecycle (similar to container components)
2. **Views**: Visual elements (UILabel, UIButton, etc.) similar to HTML elements
3. **Auto Layout**: Constraint-based layout system for responsive design
4. **Delegates**: Protocol-based callbacks (similar to props callbacks)
5. **DataSource**: Protocol for providing data to lists (UITableView/UICollectionView)

## Running the App

1. Open `InfiniteCards.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Add the JSON file to the project (if not already added):
   - Right-click on "InfiniteCards" folder in Xcode
   - Select "Add Files to InfiniteCards..."
   - Select all new Swift files and `cards.json`
   - Ensure "Copy items if needed" and "Add to targets: InfiniteCards" are checked
3. Select a simulator or device
4. Press Cmd+R to build and run

## Current Features

- Display cards in a grid layout with placeholder images
- Color-coded gradient backgrounds based on character class
- Show card stats, level, rating, and win/loss record
- Responsive layout (2 columns on phones, 3 on iPads)
- **NEW: Detailed card popup on tap** showing:
  - Full stats with progress bars
  - Social stats (likes, wins, losses, win rate)
  - Larger placeholder image with character initial
  - Smooth modal presentation with backdrop
- Tap outside popup or X button to close

## Placeholder Images

Each card displays a gradient placeholder image with:
- Class-specific color schemes:
  - **Warrior**: Red to Orange
  - **Mage/Sage/Stormcaster**: Blue to Purple
  - **Thief/Assassin/Shadowpriest**: Gray to Black
  - **Guardian/Vanguard**: Brown to Gray
  - **Ranger**: Green to Yellow
  - **Others**: Indigo to Teal
- Character's first initial displayed prominently

## Planned Features

- AI-generated character images (replacing placeholders)
- Battle system between cards
- Card generation using AI
- User authentication
- Card collection management
- Trading system
- Deck building

## How MVC Works in iOS/UIKit

### Your Current App Structure follows MVC:

```
Model (Data Layer)
├── Card.swift              // Data model
├── cards.json             // Data source

View (UI Layer)
├── CardCollectionViewCell.swift    // View component
├── UICollectionView              // Built-in view
└── UILabels, UIViews, etc.      // UI elements

Controller (Logic Layer)
├── CardsListViewController.swift   // Manages views and data
└── AppDelegate.swift              // App lifecycle
```

### The iOS MVC Pattern:

1. **Model**: Your data structures (`Card` struct)
2. **View**: UI components (cells, labels, buttons)
3. **Controller**: ViewControllers that coordinate between Model and View

However, iOS's MVC often becomes **"Massive View Controller"** because ViewControllers handle:
- View lifecycle
- User input
- Data fetching
- Navigation
- Business logic

## Modern Alternatives in iOS

### 1. **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**
Popular with SwiftUI and reactive programming:
```swift
// ViewModel
class CardListViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var cards: [Card] = []
    
    func loadCards() {
        // Load and process data
    }
}
```

### 2. **SwiftUI's Declarative Approach**
More like React:
```swift
struct CardListView: View {
    @StateObject var viewModel = CardListViewModel()
    
    var body: some View {
        List(viewModel.cards) { card in
            CardRow(card: card)
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. **Coordinator Pattern**
Separates navigation logic:
```swift
class AppCoordinator {
    func showCardDetail(for card: Card) {
        // Handle navigation
    }
}
```

### 4. **VIPER, Clean Architecture**
More complex patterns for larger apps

## Comparison with React

| React | iOS/UIKit MVC |
|-------|---------------|
| Components handle their own view + logic | ViewControllers manage views |
| Props flow down | Delegates/DataSource protocols |
| State management (Redux, Context) | Shared models, singletons |
| Functional/declarative | Object-oriented/imperative |

## Should You Use MVC?

For learning iOS/UIKit, **yes!** MVC is:
- ✅ The standard pattern for UIKit
- ✅ Well-documented
- ✅ What most iOS tutorials use
- ✅ Good for small to medium apps

Later, you might explore:
- **SwiftUI** for declarative UI (more React-like)
- **MVVM** for better separation of concerns
- **Combine/RxSwift** for reactive programming

Your current app structure is perfectly fine and follows iOS best practices! As you learn more, you'll naturally discover when and why to use different patterns.
